# StutterAI

StutterAI is an app that uses a machine learning algorithm to detect a stutter. Along with voice recognition, it will actively run a ML model trained with Apple's Sep-28k dataset to check for stutters. The Sep-28k dataset can be found <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/stuttering-event-detection">here</a>.
